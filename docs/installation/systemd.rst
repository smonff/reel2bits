Systemd configuration
----------------------

.. note::

    All the command lines below should be executed as root.

Systemd offers a convenient way to manage your reel2bits instance if you're
not using docker.

We'll see how to setup systemd to properly start a reel2bits instance.

First, copy the sample files:

.. parsed-literal::

    cp /home/reel2bits/reel2bits/deploy/reel2bits.target /etc/systemd/system/reel2bits.target
    cp /home/reel2bits/reel2bits/deploy/reel2bits-web.service /etc/systemd/system/reel2bits-web.service
    cp /home/reel2bits/reel2bits/deploy/reel2bits-worker.service /etc/systemd/system/reel2bits-worker.service

You should then edit thoses files as they are using the defaults values we used in this documentation, which might not
be what you've used.

Please look at :ref:`the dedicated configuration page <configuration-file>` for using your own settings.

By default the services assumes the configuration is `config.production_secret.Config`, which correspond to a file named `production_secret.py` in the `api/config/` directory.

Once this is done, reload systemd:

.. code-block:: shell

    systemctl daemon-reload

And start the services:

.. code-block:: shell

    systemctl start reel2bits.target

To ensure all reel2bits processes are started automatically on startup, run:

.. code-block:: shell

    systemctl enable reel2bits-web
    systemctl enable reel2bits-worker

You can check the statuses of all processes at any moment:

.. code-block:: shell

    systemctl status reel2bits-\*
